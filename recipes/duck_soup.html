        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a recipe for duck soup, which usually contains duck and other soup like <em>ingredience.</em></p>
        <p>Its real easy to make, honest, but I have to pad out the page somehow wiht some boring ass long story about the recipe like how I used to use duck soup to lure people to my lair or wahtever</p>
        <p>I got tired of typing so I th rew a recipe in google translate like a millino times but somehow google translate is better than it used to be so its not as fucked up as id like...cringe</p>
        <h3>a somewhat unique thing with water in it</h3>
        <p>It is not difficult to find restaurants in Saigon that offer a menu similar to noodles.
             It is said that the noodle dish was created by the Chinese in Southern Vietnam. 
             The noodle dish sold in stores consists of yellow noodles cooked in a thick broth and boneless duck legs that can be easily reached with tongs.</p>

        <p>The noodle dish stands out with its thick broth and rich flavor, which distinguishes it from Vietnamese and other noodle dishes. 
            The soup is considered healthy because it contains a variety of vegetables.</p>

        <p>People in Southern Vietnam usually eat this dish in restaurants because it is a home-cooked dish with many ingredients and changes seasonally. 
            A friend of mine who is a chef in Saigon taught me a recipe that I can easily make at home, that preserves the original flavor of the noodles and is great for cooking with the family. I am happy to share it with you.</p>
